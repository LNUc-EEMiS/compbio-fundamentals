# compbio-fundamentals
Course material for "Fundamentals of computational biology"

## Dowloading the repo

You can download this repo to your own computer. The best way is to *clone* it using Git. If you do, it will be easy to
update when new material is added or old material is modified *plus* you will learn a little about working with Git.

*How to* clone the repo depends on your computer's operating system: Mac OS X, Linux or MS Windows.

### Mac OS X and Linux

OS X and Linux both have *Bash* builtin and usually comes installed with Git. Cloning this repos is as easy as:

```
mkdir dev # Or another directory where you want to have the repo
cd dev
git clone https://github.com/LNUc-EEMiS/compbio-fundamentals.git
cd compbio-fundamentals
```

### Windows

Windows is a little bit different since it doesn't have the same kind of command line program as OS X and Linux
(although it's rumoured that the latest version actually has Bash). You can download it from here: 
https://git-scm.com/download/win.

Once you have installed it, start the program and it will present a command line interface with Bash. You can then
proceed like the above example for OS X and Linux.

## Book project

Included in the course is writing a book summarising what we bring up during the course, that
can be used as reference material and as text book for future courses.

You can contribute to the book, see the [README.md in the book directory](book/README.md).
