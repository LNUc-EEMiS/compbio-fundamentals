# Fundamentals of computational biology

PhD student course, Kalmar, December 2018 - June 2019

## Audience

The course is aimed at PhD students with little or no experience in computing who are facing analysis of large datasets from e.g. nucleotide sequencing. Other researchers in a similar situation are also welcome to apply.

## Aim

This course aims to provide sufficient knowledge about how to work with common bioinformatics tools in a Linux environment to allow you to confidently and effectively address your biological questions with  your data.

## Description

The course will be given in five whole day instalments consisting of lectures, demonstrations, practicals and group discussions followed by presentations. The lectures, demonstrations and practicals will provide background information, demonstrate and let you practice a range of computational tools spanning from the Linux command line, including tools to organize and configure your working environment, source code control (Git), to data analysis with R/Tidyverse.

In groups you will discuss and analyze your work with colleagues from other research groups working with similar data but different research questions. Each group will present conclusions from their discussions to the whole group for further discussions.

**Credits** â€“ active participation in the entire course, including attendance during discussions, corresponds to 4 hp.

## Requirements

You need a laptop and an UPPMAX account (http://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/). During the first instalment we will show how to connect your laptop to the UPPMAX cluster Rackham. This is easy for Linux and Mac OS X users, but a little bit more involved for Windows users.

## Schedule

The first instalment of the course will be December 12 9.00-16.30 and the second January 23.

Dates for the following three instalments have not yet been decided. We aim for one per month.
