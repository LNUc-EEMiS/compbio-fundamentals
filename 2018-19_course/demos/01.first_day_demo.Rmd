```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r read-table}
counts <- read_tsv(
  '../../data/atacama-soils.asvtable.tsv',
  col_types = cols(
    .default = col_double(),
    seqid = col_character()
  )
) %>%
  gather(sample, count, 2:67) %>%
  filter(count > 0)
```

```{r}
counts %>%
  group_by(sample) %>% summarise(count = sum(count)) %>% ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = sample, x = count)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1000)
```

```{r filter-1000}
counts <- counts %>%
  group_by(sample) %>%
  filter(sum(count) >= 1000) %>%
  ungroup()
```

After looking at the sequencing depths, we decided to remove samples with less than 1000 counts. After
filtering `r counts %>% distinct(sample) %>% nrow()` samples remained.
