# Annotation of biological sequences {#annotation}

The word \index{annotation}*annotation* in relation to biological sequences means someone have made
a note about things like which organism the sequence comes from or its function in a wide sense. A
typical example is when you look up a protein at \index{NCBI}NCBI or \index{Uniprot}Uniprot:

How you get from a sequence to an annotated sequence depends on what you know beforehand. In the
above example, the researchers knew they were working with sequences from a *Nostoc* sp. and did not
need to do anything for the \index{taxonomic annotation}*taxonomic annotation*. The functional part
of the annotation -- i.e. that it's a nitrogenase reductase, *nifH* gene -- was in this case also
known prior to sequencing. This had been determined earlier by experimental annealing of the
*Klebsiella* sp. *nifH* gene to a cloned DNA fragment from *Nostoc* sp.

## Homology as an annotation tool

The above example is nowadays rare and we often have the reverse situation: When sequences arrive we
neither know from which organism they came from -- if the sequences don't come from an isolate but
from an environmental sample of DNA, i.e. metagenomics or metatranscriptomics -- nor what functional
annotations to attach to them. The principle that is most often used for annotation is
\index{homology}*homology*, i.e. shared evolutionary descent between a set of sequences.
