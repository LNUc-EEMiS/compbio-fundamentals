# Working with amplicon sequences {#amplicon-sequences}

## Introduction

Sequencing PCR products, amplicons, of a gene deemed as a good taxonomic marker is a very common
technique in microbial ecology. For Bacteria and Archaea, the gene that is almost always used is the
gene encoding the RNA molecule of the small subunit (SSU) of the ribosome, the 16S rRNA
[@lane_rapid_1985]. For other organism groups, other molecules, such as the end of the SSU rRNA gene
plus the following internal transcribed spacer (ITS), might be better choices.

The 16S gene has been selected as a taxonomical marker for several reasons:

1. It is present in all cellular organisms (although it's called 18S in eukaryotes).

2. It is believed to very rarely transfer horizontally between cells, which would entangle the
   relationships we rely on for taxonomy.

3. It contains both highly conserved and not so conserved regions. The latter, more variable
   regions, are numbered and called V1-V9 [see e.g. @chakravorty_detailed_2007]. The highly
   conserved regions are used as primer sites and the more variable are used to discriminate taxa.
   The variable regions are selected to form a product of suitable length for your sequencing
   method.

There are computer programs that facilitates design of primers [e.g. @hugerth_degeprime_2014], but
in practice a few region combinations with primers are used. In many Swedish research groups Anders
Andersson's primers for the V3V4 (around 400-450 bp; suitable for Illumina MiSeq 2x300 bp) are used
(see [lab protocol](https://github.com/EnvGen/LabProtocols)). Recently, the V4V5 region has been
proposed as a superior choice, in particular for its suitability for Archaea
[@walters_improved_2016, @parada_marine_2017].

### Contamination {#amplicon-contamination}

In certain projects, usually those with very small amounts of DNA, we have observed problems with
contamination of DNA from reagents used in the processing of DNA from filters
[@salter_reagent_2014]. This is not unique for amplicon-based sequencing, but the amplification
performed inflates the problem. To address this, one should routinely sequence samples of pure water
that has gone through all the steps of the sample preparation process and subtract these sequences
from analyses.

@yeh_taxon_2017 recently published a report of a mysterious disapperance of certain taxa from a
sequencing run. They were able to resolv this problem as they routinely added a sample of a mock
community (just a defined mix of genomic DNA) to their sequencing runs.
