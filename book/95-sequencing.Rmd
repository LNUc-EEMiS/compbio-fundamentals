- *How are Illumina quality scores calculated?* \index{Illumina quality scores}Illumina quality
  scores are calculated based on a "set of quality predictor values" which are "updated when
  characteristics of the sequencing platform change" (quotes from Illumina documentation
  (@illumina_understanding_2014)). Illumina is not more specific about the quality predictor values
  than saying "such as intensity profiles and signal-to-noise ratios".
