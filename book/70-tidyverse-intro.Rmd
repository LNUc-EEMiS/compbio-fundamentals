# Introduction to data science with R/Tidyverse {#tidyverse-intro}

There's an excellent book describing the Tidyverse written by Hadley Wickham, the author of the
Tidyverse, together with Garrett Grolemund: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
[@wickham_r_2017]. When you're done with that and want more, there is: [Advanced
R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) [@wickham_advanced_2019], also by Hadley Wickham.

## Good habits {#r-good-habits}

- Dont use `setwd()` in your scripts

- Define as few tables as possible

- Don't write intermediate tables to file

- Write scripts for heavy analyses that need not be rerun; work with figures and tables in RMarkdown
  documents (see \@ref(rmarkdown)).

## RMarkdown/Rnotebooks {#rmarkdown}

```{r include=FALSE}
# vim:tw=100
```
