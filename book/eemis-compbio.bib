In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.},

	abstract = {The taxonomic composition of a microbial community can be deduced by analyzing its rRNA gene content by, e.g., high-throughput DNA sequencing or DNA chips. Such methods typically are based on PCR amplification of rRNA gene sequences using broad-taxonomic-range PCR primers. In these analyses, the use of optimal primers is crucial for achieving an unbiased representation of community composition. Here, we present the computer program DegePrime that, for each position of a multiple sequence alignment, finds a degenerate oligomer of as high coverage as possible and outputs its coverage among taxonomic divisions. We show that our novel heuristic, which we call weighted randomized combination, performs better than previously described algorithms for solving the maximum coverage degenerate primer design problem. We previously used DegePrime to design a broad-taxonomic-range primer pair that targets the bacterial V3-V4 region (341F-805R) (D. P. Herlemann, M. Labrenz, K. Jurgens, S. Bertilsson, J. J. Waniek, and A. F. Andersson, ISME J. 5:1571–1579, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2011.41), and here we use the program to significantly increase the coverage of a primer pair (515F-806R) widely used for Illumina-based surveys of bacterial and archaeal diversity. By comparison with shotgun metagenomics, we show that the primers give an accurate representation of microbial diversity in natural samples.},

	abstract = {Although the applicability of small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequences for bacterial classification is now well accepted, the general use of these molecules has been hindered by the technical difficulty of obtaining their sequences. A protocol is described for rapidly generating large blocks of 16S rRNA sequence data without isolation of the 16S rRNA or cloning of its gene. The 16S rRNA in bulk cellular RNA preparations is selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing by using reverse transcriptase and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to universally conserved 16S rRNA sequences. Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major 16S rRNA structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of 16S rRNA sequence. The method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template RNA, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several 16S rRNAs whose gene sequences are known. The relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the 16S rRNA sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes contain nine “hypervariable regions” (V1 – V9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. Species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1 - V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1 – V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterial species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the “MEGALIGN” files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.},

	doi = {10.1101/206219},
	abstract = {Mock communities have been used in microbiome method development to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification, sequencing, and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the necessity of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed \&gt;2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded 'normal' results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, due to natural variation of microbiomes at our site, we easily could have missed the problem had we not used the mock communities. The 'normal' results were validated over 4 MiSeqPE300 runs and 3 HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low (Bray-Curtis distance was 0.12±0.04). While validating these 'normal' results, we also discovered some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We suggest that using mock communities in every sequencing run is essential to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. Such mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed, to detect problems that show up only in some taxa, as we observed.},

Here, we examined the performance of modiﬁed 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for archaea/bacteria and fungi, respectively, with nonaquatic samples. We moved primer bar codes to the 5= end, allowing for a range of different 3= primer pairings, such as the 515f/926r primer pair, which ampliﬁes variable regions 4 and 5 of the 16S rRNA gene. We additionally demonstrated that modiﬁcations to the 515f/806r (variable region 4) 16S primer pair, which improves detection of Thaumarchaeota and clade SAR11 in marine samples, do not degrade performance on taxa already ampliﬁed effectively by the original primer set. Alterations to the fungal ITS primers did result in differential but overall improved performance compared to the original primers. In both cases, the improved primers should be widely adopted for amplicon studies.},

MGI and MGII communities demonstrated distinct compositions at different depths, and seasonality at all depths. Microbial association networks at 150 m, 500 m and 890 m, revealed diverse assemblages of MGI (presumed ammonia oxidizers) and Nitrospina taxa (presumed dominant nitrite oxidizers, completing the nitrification process), suggesting distinct MGI-Nitrospina OTUs are responsible for nitrification at different depths and seasons, and depth- related and seasonal variability in nitrification could be affected by alternating MGI-Nitrospina assemblages. MGII taxa also showed distinct correlations to possibly heterotrophic bacteria, most commonly to members of Marine Group A, Chloroflexi, Marine Group B, and SAR86. Thus, both MGI and MGII likely have dynamic associations with bacteria based on similarities in activity or other interactions that select for distinct microbial assemblages over time. The importance of MGII taxa as members of the heterotrophic community previously reported for photic zone appears to apply throughout the water column.},
