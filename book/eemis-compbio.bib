	abstract = {The taxonomic composition of a microbial community can be deduced by analyzing its rRNA gene content by, e.g., high-throughput DNA sequencing or DNA chips. Such methods typically are based on PCR amplification of rRNA gene sequences using broad-taxonomic-range PCR primers. In these analyses, the use of optimal primers is crucial for achieving an unbiased representation of community composition. Here, we present the computer program DegePrime that, for each position of a multiple sequence alignment, finds a degenerate oligomer of as high coverage as possible and outputs its coverage among taxonomic divisions. We show that our novel heuristic, which we call weighted randomized combination, performs better than previously described algorithms for solving the maximum coverage degenerate primer design problem. We previously used DegePrime to design a broad-taxonomic-range primer pair that targets the bacterial V3-V4 region (341F-805R) (D. P. Herlemann, M. Labrenz, K. Jurgens, S. Bertilsson, J. J.

Andersson, ISME J. 5:1571–1579, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2011.41), and here we use the program to significantly increase the coverage of a primer pair (515F-806R) widely used for Illumina-based surveys of bacterial and archaeal diversity. By comparison with shotgun metagenomics, we show that the primers give an accurate representation of microbial diversity in natural samples.},

A protocol is described for rapidly generating large blocks of 16S rRNA sequence data without isolation of the 16S rRNA or cloning of its gene. The 16S rRNA in bulk cellular RNA preparations is selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing by using reverse transcriptase and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to universally conserved 16S rRNA sequences. Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major 16S rRNA structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of 16S rRNA sequence. The method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template RNA, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several 16S rRNAs whose gene sequences are known. The relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the 16S rRNA sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.},

Species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1 - V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1 – V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterial species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the “MEGALIGN” files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.},

	abstract = {Mock communities have been used in microbiome method development to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification, sequencing, and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the necessity of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed \&gt;2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded 'normal' results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, due to natural variation of microbiomes at our site, we easily could have missed the problem had we not used the mock communities. The 'normal' results were validated over 4 MiSeqPE300 runs and 3 HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low (Bray-Curtis distance was 0.12±0.04). While validating these 'normal' results, we also discovered some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We suggest that using mock communities in every sequencing run is essential to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. Such mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed, to detect problems that show up only in some taxa, as we observed.},

We additionally demonstrated that modiﬁcations to the 515f/806r (variable region 4) 16S primer pair, which improves detection of Thaumarchaeota and clade SAR11 in marine samples, do not degrade performance on taxa already ampliﬁed effectively by the original primer set. Alterations to the fungal ITS primers did result in differential but overall improved performance compared to the original primers.

MGI and MGII communities demonstrated distinct compositions at different depths, and seasonality at all depths. Microbial association networks at 150 m, 500 m and 890 m, revealed diverse assemblages of MGI (presumed ammonia oxidizers) and Nitrospina taxa (presumed dominant nitrite oxidizers, completing the nitrification process), suggesting distinct MGI-Nitrospina OTUs are responsible for nitrification at different depths and seasons, and depth- related and seasonal variability in nitrification could be affected by alternating MGI-Nitrospina assemblages. MGII taxa also showed distinct correlations to possibly heterotrophic bacteria, most commonly to members of Marine Group A, Chloroflexi, Marine Group B, and SAR86. Thus, both MGI and MGII likely have dynamic associations with bacteria based on similarities in activity or other interactions that select for distinct microbial assemblages over time. The importance of MGII taxa as members of the heterotrophic community previously reported for photic zone appears to apply throughout the water column.},

Analyses of gene sequences in various closely related prokaryotic groups reveal that sequence diversity is typically organized into distinct clusters, and processes such as periodic selection and extensive recombination are understood to be drivers of cluster formation (“speciation”). However, observed patterns are rarely compared with those obtainable with simple null models of diversification under stochastic lineage birth and death and random genetic drift. Via a combination of simulations and analyses of core and phylogenetic marker genes, we show that patterns of diversity for the genera Escherichia, Neisseria, and Borrelia are generally indistinguishable from patterns arising under a null model. We suggest that caution should thus be taken in interpreting observed clustering as a result of selective evolutionary forces. Unknown forces do, however, appear to play a role in Helicobacter pylori, and some individual genes in all groups fail to conform to the null model. Taken together, we recommend the presented birth−death model as a null hypothesis in prokaryotic speciation studies. It is only when the real data are statistically different from the expectations under the null model that some speciation process should be invoked.},

The past half-century of bacterial systematics has been characterized by improvements in methods for demarcating species as phenotypic and genetic clusters, but species demarcation has not been guided by a theory-based concept of species. Eukaryote systematists have developed a universal concept of species: A species is a group of organisms whose divergence is capped by a force of cohesion; divergence between different species is irreversible; and different species are ecologically distinct. In the case of bacteria, these universal properties are held not by the named species of systematics but by ecotypes. These are populations of organisms occupying the same ecological niche, whose divergence is purged recurrently by natural selection. These ecotypes can be discovered by several universal sequence-based approaches. These molecular methods suggest that a typical named species contains many ecotypes, each with the universal attributes of species. A named bacterial species is thus more like a genus than a species.},

This approach has identified multiple ecotypes within traditional species, with each predicted to be an ecologically distinct lineage; many such ecotypes were confirmed to be ecologically distinct, with specialization to different canyon slopes with different solar exposures.

Genomics now offers novel insights into intra-species diversity and the potential for emergence of a more soundly based system. Although we share the excitement, we argue that it is premature for a universal change to the definition because current knowledge is based on too few phylogenetic groups and too few samples of natural populations. Our analysis of five important bacterial groups suggests, however, that more stringent standards for species may be justifiable when a solid understanding of gene content and ecological distinctiveness becomes available. Our analysis also reveals what is actually encompassed in a species according to the current standards, in terms of whole-genome sequence and gene-content diversity, and shows that this does not correspond to coherent clusters for the environmental Burkholderia and Shewanella genera examined. In contrast, the obligatory pathogens, which have a very restricted ecological niche, do exhibit clusters. Therefore, the idea of biologically meaningful clusters of diversity that applies to most eukaryotes may not be universally applicable in the microbial world, or if such clusters exist, they may be found at different levels of distinction.},

	abstract = {Taxonomy relies on three key elements: characterization, classification and nomenclature. All three elements are dynamic fields, but each step depends on the one which precedes it. Thus, the nomenclature of a group of organisms depends on the way they are classified, and the classification (among other elements) depends on the information gathered as a result of characterization. While nomenclature is governed by the Bacteriological Code, the classification and characterization of prokaryotes is an area that is not formally regulated and one in which numerous changes have taken place in the last 50 years. The purpose of the present article is to outline the key elements in the way that prokaryotes are characterized, with a view to providing an overview of some of the pitfalls commonly encountered in taxonomic papers.},

	abstract = {Among available genome relatedness indices, average nucleotide identity (ANI) is one of the most robust measurements of genomic relatedness between strains, and has great potential in the taxonomy of bacteria and archaea as a substitute for the labour-intensive DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) technique. An ANI threshold range (95–96 \%) for species demarcation had previously been suggested based on comparative investigation between DDH and ANI values, albeit with rather limited datasets. Furthermore, its generality was not tested on all lineages of prokaryotes. Here, we investigated the overall distribution of ANI values generated by pairwise comparison of 6787 genomes of prokaryotes belonging to 22 phyla to see whether the suggested range can be applied to all species. There was an apparent distinction in the overall ANI distribution between intra- and interspecies relationships at around 95–96 \% ANI. We went on to determine which level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity corresponds to the currently accepted ANI threshold for species demarcation using over one million comparisons. A twofold cross-validation statistical test revealed that 98.65 \% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity can be used as the threshold for differentiating two species, which is consistent with previous suggestions (98.2–99.0 \%) derived from comparative studies between DDH and 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Our findings should be useful in accelerating the use of genomic sequence data in the taxonomy of bacteria and archaea.},
