# Alphabetical list of computer terms {#computer-terms}

- *Disk*:

- *Manual/Man page*: Classical help system in UNIX computers, see \@ref(cli-getting-help).
- *Memory*:

- *Regular expression*: A string that describes other strings; used as a search tool. See
  \@ref(regexps).

- *Script*/*scripting language*: A *scripting language* is a programming language that is not
  compiled, i.e. you don't have to process your code with any tool before running it. Today,
  scripting languages, such as *R* and *Python* are very popular particularly in computational
  sciences. Another scripting language that is commonly seen is *Bash* or other *shell* scripting
  languages. Scripts written in Bash are examples of how the program you're using when interacting
  with the computer -- the shell -- can be used to automate tasks. In essence, writing a shell
  script is just collecting a number of commands you regularly issue at the command prompt to
  perform some task, usually together with some program logic in the form of *if else* or *while*
  clauses plus variables to make the script more general.
