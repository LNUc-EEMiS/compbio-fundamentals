# Alphabetical list of computer terms {#computer-terms}

- \index{algorithm}*Algorithm*: Instructions for a computation, i.e. instructions, usually
  implemented in a computer program, that will take you from an input to an output.

- *CLI* or *Command Line Interface*: A program that is written in a way to let you control it from
  the "command line", i.e. the *shell* in a UNIX computer.

- *Disk*: Although today, after the advent of solid state storage (SSD), not the only form of
  *permanent* storage in a computer the term *disk* storage is usually used synonymous with
  *permanent storage*, i.e. where files and programs are stored when not in use.

- *GUI* or *Graphical User Interface*: A program that is written with a graphical interface.

- \index{heuristic algorithm}*Heuristic algorithm*: An algorithm (see above) that does not promise
  to give you the theoretically correct answer, but a good answer. Heuristics are used when a
  problem is too complicated to solve exactly in reasonable time. A very well known heuristic
  algorithm is the one implemented in the \index{BLAST}BLAST search and align program. Important
  heuristic algorithms can also be found in e.g. OTU clustering, see \@ref(otu-clustering).

- *Manual/Man page*: Classical help system in UNIX computers, see \@ref(cli-getting-help).

- *Memory*: **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory (RAM), or *memory* in short, is the working memory for
  the computer. Any program you start will be placed in memory together with any data it is using.
  Having too little memory is a common reason why computers feels slow. Using fewer programs is a
  way of dealing with that.

- *Regular expression*: A string that describes other strings; used as a search tool. See
  \@ref(regexps).

- *Script*/*scripting language*: A *scripting language* is a programming language that is not
  compiled, i.e. you don't have to process your code with any tool before running it. Today,
  scripting languages, such as *R* and *Python*, are very popular particularly in computational
  sciences. Another scripting language that is commonly seen is *Bash* or other *shell* scripting
  languages. Scripts written in Bash are examples of how the program you're using when interacting
  with the computer -- the shell -- can be used to automate tasks. In essence, writing a shell
  script is just collecting a number of commands you regularly issue at the command prompt to
  perform some task, together with some program logic in the form of *if else* or *while* clauses
  plus variables to make the script more general.

- *Shell*: A terminal, or *command line* program to control the computer. The most common example
  today is Bash. See \@ref(linux-cli).
