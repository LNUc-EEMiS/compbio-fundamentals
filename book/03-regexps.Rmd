# Regular expressions {#regexps}

Regular expressions, or *regexps*, are strings that describe classes of strings. E.g. the regexp
"Nrd[A-Z]" describes, or *matches*, the strings "NrdA", "NrdB", "NrdC" or any other string that
starts with "Nrd" and continues with a capital letter. Regexps are often called *patterns*. Regexps
are used to *search* for strings and in tools that *modify* strings. 

There are two types of characters in regexps: regular characters and *metacharacters*. The former
makes up the majority and just matches itself; examples include letters, numbers, space and most
other characters. The latter, the metacharacters, are characters that matches something else than a
literal character. Two very common examples are `.` and `*`. The `.` matches not a literal character
but *any character*, whereas the `*` is a *multiplier* specifying that the character before it could
occur any number of times, including zero. A `.*` pattern hence means "match anything, any number of
times" (which is, of course, rather useless on its own, but is useful when mixed with other
characters).

If you want to search for a literal character, but the specific character, e.g. `.`, is a
metacharacter, you can escape it, usually by preceding it with a `\`. `\.` would hence match a
literal period. In some cases, particularly tools that are older than Perl, such as grep, awk and
sed, there are missing metacharacters. To turn regular characters into metacharacters in these
cases, you have to escape the regular character. An example is `(` and `)` which in Perl and many
other regexp engines are used to "capture" what was matched for later use, but in standard sed just
means literal parentheses. To capture text and modify it with `sed` you could e.g. write
`s/Nrd\([A-Za-z]\)/Nrd\U\1/` (match "Nrd" followed by any letter and make sure the letter is capital
(`\U`: upper case)). See also the grep alternation example in \@ref(grep)  below.

Table: (\#tab:regexp-metacharacters) Common metacharacters used in regular expressions. *Often,
but not always, the function of an absent metacharacter can be gotten by escaping the corresponding 
regular character, e.g. `\|` to use alternation in grep or sed.

Below, a few tools that implement regexps are described.

## Grep {#grep}

The `grep` program^[Supposedly, "grep" stands for "globally search a regular expression and print".]
is a standard UNIX search tool commonly used on its own or in pipelines to search for *rows* in
files that contain a regexp.

```
# Search for a user named "dl" in the user database
grep dl /etc/passwd

# Search for RNR proteins in a fasta file containing NCBI's NR database
# (The quotes are not necessary, but a good habit to make sure regexps not
# mistakenly match file globs.)
grep "Nrd[ABDEFJ]" nr.faa

# Subset results to mouse and human, assuming the species name comes after the 
# protein name.
# This pattern uses *alternation* when looking for either mouse or human.
# (The parentheses and pipe are not metacharacters in grep, so we have to escape 
# them.)
grep "Nrd[ABDEFJ].*\(Mus musculus\)\|\(Homo sapiens\)" nr.faa

# If we're not certain that protein name comes before species, build a pipeline
grep "Nrd[ABDEFJ]" nr.faa | grep "\(Mus musculus\)\|\(Homo sapiens\)"
```

## Sed {#sed}

## Awk {#awk}

## R {#r-regexps}

```{r include=FALSE}
# vim:tw=100
```
