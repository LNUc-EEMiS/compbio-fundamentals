# Introduction to phylogenetics {#phylogenetics}

Most of the topics in this book are just introduced, and when you start using the tools you will
have to study the original literature. This is true to a probably greater extent for phylogenetics
which is a truly vast area of computational methodology. It is also one which has for long been
fraught by strongly held opinions bordering on methodological wars. In this chapter I will try to
give an overview of available tools and methods, together with some advice on how to address typical
situations and problems. I will try to be neutral, but at times my own opinions might shine through,
since I actually want to convey some personal expericences of mine in the hope they might be useful
to you.

## \index{multiple sequence alignment}Multiple sequence \index{alignment}alignments, homology and trees {#multiple-sequence-alignment}

Today, the most common starting point to estimate a phylogenetic tree are nucleotide or protein
sequences. Moreover, the sequences are aligned so that corresponding positions are placed at the
same relative positions. The idea behind aligning sequences like this is that we can capture
nucleotides or amino acids that are \index{homology}*homologous*, i.e. are derived from the same
nucleotide or amino acid state in a common ancestral sequence. This is similar to the alignments
that were discussed in the chapter about annotation (chapter \@ref(annotation)), but whereas they
were *pairwise*, the alignments you use for estimating trees are *multiple*, i.e. contain more than
two sequences.

An alignment of a few rather similar protein sequences can look like this (in *phylip* format):

It is often better to look at sequence alignments in specialized programs, e.g.
[Seaview](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview), [ClustalX](http://www.clustal.org/) or
[JalView](http://www.jalview.org/).

![*View of a multiple sequence alignment in Seaview*. Programs that display and lets you work with
multiple sequence alignments colours amino acids so it's easier to see *conservative substitutions*,
i.e. substitutions between biochemically similar amino acids.](img/seaview_screenshot.png)
